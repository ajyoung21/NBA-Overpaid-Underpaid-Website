# NBA-Overpaid-Underpaid-Website

Hello. Obviously, almost everything is within the Web Visualizations folder. Here are the most important files and folders that you need to know:

1. NBA Salary Data Analysis.ipynb : This Jupyter notebook contains my initial data analysis. I merged the two .csv files (located in Resources), created some initial graphs in matplotlib, and used this to query the most overpaid and underpaid players.

2. Page Generators : Since I was using plotly to generate interactive visuals, I needed python codes to generate those html pages with the plotly charts. I mostly copy and pasted my code from the Jupyter notebook to get there.

3. Pages : From those generated pages, I used Bootstrap and html to write and present my analysis, which you can find here: https://ajyoung21.github.io/NBA-Overpaid-Underpaid-Website/
