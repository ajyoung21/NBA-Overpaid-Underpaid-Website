    <center><h2><strong>Data Limitations</strong></h2></center>
    <ul>
    <li>Much of the data before the 1976 NBA-ABA merger is incomplete. As a result, all-time great players like Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain aren't on the list. The NBA before the merger was also a different league from the one we know today. This is why I split the data into a "Pre-Merger"category and added players drafted from 1976-1979 into the "1980s" category.
    <li>While the data from the two .csv files that I used had the earnings for each player for every year, I could not get the individual stats for each player for each year. Instead, the data only had a player's career stats (Career Points Per Game, Career PER, Career Win Shares etc.) as opposed to their PPG, Win Shares in a given year. I decided to evaluate players by "Career Win Shares" because Win Shares is an advance, catch-all analytic and because I could use it to compare the total value of their on-court production compared to the total money they earned over the course of their career.
    <li>These charts do not account for injuries. Many star players will lose seasons due to an ACL or achilles tear, yet still get paid while they are sidelined. Thus, their Career Earnings will increase while they won't have an opportunity to increase their Career Win Shares. In the long run, they may seem relatively overpaid even if they were outplaying their contract when healthy.
    </ul>
    <center><h2><strong>Other Factors</strong></h2></center>
    <ul>
    <li>There's more to life that winning games! Teams may sign players because they're popular and can earn revenue. A player like Jeremy Lin may not have been an all-star for the Houston Rockets, but he definitely helped increase their popularity in China and increased their long-term revenue. Kobe Bryant earned $50 million his last two years in the league despite being a subpar player coming off of an achilles tear. This had largely to do because he continued to make Los Angeles Lakers relevant and one of the hottest tickets in the league.

    <center><h2><strong>Important Events To Consider</strong></h2></center>
    There are a number of events that greatly changed the salary landscape of the NBA, many of which gave teams more money to spend on players. A player's career earnings depends on the financial circumstances surrounding the league in as much as their talent when negotiating a contract.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>1976:</strong> The NBA and ABA merge, with four teams coming from the ABA to the NBA. This set the stage for the NBA to become the extremely profitable league it is today.
    <li><strong>1984-1985:</strong> The NBA implements a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_salary_cap#History'> salary cap of $3.6 Million</a>, limiting the amount of money teams can spend on talent.
    <li><strong>1995:</strong> The NBA establishes a rookie scale that limits how much money rookies can make on their first contract.
    <li><strong>1999:</strong> After ending the '98-'99 lockout, the <a href='http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap#Q7'>NBA establishes maximum contracts</a> for players, limiting the amount that the league's highest paid superstars can make. The NBA also establishes a luxury tax which makes it more costly for teams to spend over the salary cap.
    <li><strong>2016:</strong> The NBA <a href='https://www.si.com/nba/2014/10/05/new-nba-tv-deal-worth-24-billion'>renews it's television deal with ESPN and Turner sports</a>, going from making $966 Million/year to $2.46 Billion/year. This drastically increases league revenue and causes the salary cap to jump from $70 Million to $94 Million. That summer and subsequent summers would see record spending sprees on free agents.
    <li><strong>2017:</strong> In an effort to keep star players from leaving in Free Agency, the NBA creates the <a href='http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap#Q24'>"Designated Player Exception"</a> or "Supermax" contract. John Wall, Steph Curry, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden have all signed Supermax contracts to the tune of 4-years, $170-$201 Million.
    <li><strong>2019:</strong> Daryl Morey's tweet about Hong Kong spurs friction between the NBA and the Chinese government. It is estimated that 10-20% of league revenue could be in jeopardy should the Chinese government cancel its television deal with the NBA.
